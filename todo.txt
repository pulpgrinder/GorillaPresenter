Make CTRL-S and CMD-S save the current editor (as well as ESC). Or save all editors and download? Maybe that would be better, come to think about it.

Export to full-page print and 6-up handouts.

Put cursor at top of editor on initial showing. Focus editors on display.

Clicking too fast skips transitions. Need to queue them up somehow. This is still happening somehow. Unrecognized race condition? Continue to investigate.


Gets confused if full screen is exited via escape, from right-click menu, or from top menu bar rather than internal menu. Error is VM1281:581 Uncaught (in promise) TypeError: Failed to execute 'exitFullscreen' on 'Document': Document not active
    at Object.exitFullScreen (<anonymous>:581:18)
    at HTMLDivElement.processMainMenuClick (<anonymous>:52:31)
exitFullScreen @ VM1281:581
processMainMenuClick @ VM1281:52

Probably need to change the toggle if fullscreen is exited/entered via alternate method.
