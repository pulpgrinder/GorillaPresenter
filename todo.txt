Slide body text needs a bit more padding at least for printing.
Right margin is a little tight on plain text slides.


Maybe scale the text a little larger for printing 1up slides.

Maybe try scaling the text down if the slide is overfull.

Maybe make the 6up slides a bit larger.

Wire up editor buttons

Editor cheatsheet.

Need to replace spaces in title for audio (and maybe other media) with %20, maybe.

Outlines?



Need classes and directives for single inline links and branches.

Weirdness in media library "Can't rename". 

Media library screen is a little plain. Make it prettier. Add trash buttons.

Icons needed: Video, audio, book, external link, internal link...
