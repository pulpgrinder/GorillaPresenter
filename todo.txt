O'Keeffe not working (probably due to apostrophe)

Media library screen is a little plain. Make it prettier. Add trash button.

Test importing of audio and video.

Make CTRL-S and CMD-S save the current editor (as well as ESC). Or save all editors and download? Maybe that would be better, come to think about it.

I think that CTRL/CMD-S should save the editor and return to the slide show, if the slide editor is active. If on the home screen, should download the self-contained app. Think about this some more, though.


Clicking too fast skips transitions. Need to queue them up somehow. This is still happening somehow. Unrecognized race condition? Continue to investigate. Seems to be fixed? Torture test this.
