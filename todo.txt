Use horizontal rule --- to divide slides rather than first-level heading? How to do titles for the sorter, then?

Menu runs off the screen on mobile? Possibly this was fixed -- check

CSS for inline code is really ugly. So is blockquote.

Slide body text needs a bit more padding at least for printing.
Right margin is a little tight on plain text slides.


Maybe scale the text a little larger for printing 1up slides.


Wire up editor buttons

Editor cheatsheet.


Need to replace spaces in title for audio (and maybe other media) with %20, maybe.

Need to add history stack so going back from a branch works properly. Done? Needs more testing.


Outlines?

* Need to define class for second-level heading in navigable list (e.g., question from a quiz) Make questions stand out from answers with CSS. Still needs some work.


Need classes and directives for single inline links and branches.

Weirdness in media library "Can't rename". 

Media library screen is a little plain. Make it prettier. Add trash buttons.

Some sort of bug with the screen time for popup messages (e.g. the one about experimental languages)

Clicking too fast skips transitions. Need to queue them up somehow. This is still happening somehow. Unrecognized race condition? Continue to investigate. Seems to be fixed? Torture test this.

Icons needed: Video, audio, book, external link, internal link...
