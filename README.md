# Gorilla Presenter

Gorilla Presenter is a complete presentation tool packed into **a single HTML file**. Everything lives there: the slides themselves, the editor, a media recorder (for desktop Chrome, Brave, and Firefox), and supporting resources. Basic use doesn't require installing any apps or that you even have an internet connection—just open the file in your regular web browser. The goal is to support all major modern desktop and mobile browsers (i.e., **not** Internet Explorer). Some plugins (for instance, Maps and Wikipedia) do require a network connection, but the basic system will work just fine without one.

(Quick note for iPhone or iPad users: you'll need Microsoft Edge, since it's currently the only mobile browser for Apple devices that lets you open local HTML files from the device's file system.)

Because it's just one file, sharing is easy. Email it, drop it on a USB drive, or hand it over however you like—the recipient can view and even edit it without installing anything or visiting a website.

You create slides using ordinary Markdown, plus a handful of presentation-friendly extensions (things like autoplay timing, auto-embedded audio/video, custom navigation menus, and several others).

You can use branches, outlines, and menus to create self-directed tutorials.

The easiest way to understand what Gorilla Presenter can do is to head to the [home page](https://gorillapresenter.com). There you'll find a working example you can view right away—and you can download your own copy to open, edit, and adapt as you see fit. You can also find a copy here in the dist directory. Depending on how fast development is occurring, that copy may be slightly fresher than the one on the home page.
