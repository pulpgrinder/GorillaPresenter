# Gorilla Presenter

Gorilla Presenter is a complete presentation tool packed into **a single HTML file**. Everything lives there: the slides themselves, the editor, a media recorder, and supporting resources. You don't need to install any apps or rely on an internet connection—just open the file in a regular web browser.

(Quick note for iPhone or iPad users: you'll need Microsoft Edge, since it's currently the only mobile browser that lets you open local HTML files from the device's file system.)

Because it's just one file, sharing is easy. Email it, drop it on a USB drive, or hand it over however you like—the recipient can view and even edit it without installing anything or visiting a website.

You create slides using ordinary Markdown, plus a handful of presentation-friendly extensions (things like autoplay timing, embedded audio/video, custom navigation menus, and several others that make life easier during talks).

The easiest way to understand what it can do is to head to the home page. There you'll find a working example you can view right away—and you can download your own copy to open, edit, and adapt as you see fit.
