# Gorilla Presenter

Gorilla Presenter is a fully self-contained presentation program. The entire system -- presentation, editor, media recorder, resources -- is contained in a single HTML file. No apps. No servers. The only thing you need for creating and displaying presentations is a normal web browser (iPhoneOS and iPadOS do require installing Microsoft Edge, as it is the only browser that currently allows opening HTML files from the device's file system).

This also means that your presentation can be emailed, distributed on a thumb drive, or whatever, without worrying about the recipient being able to view it.

Slides are created using standard Markdown, with some specialty extensions aimed at presentations (e.g., autoplay, multimedia, custom menus, numerous others).

The best way to get a feel for Gorilla Presenter's capabilities is to visit the home page. You can not only view a presentation, you can get your own copy which can be edited as you wish.
