Contributions are welcome, whether in the form of code (new functionality, bug fixes, clarification), improved documentation, or feature requests. 

You must explicitly license your new code or documentation under an MIT license identical to the one Gorilla Presenter itself uses.

If you have just a trivial bug fix, it's okay to raise an issue and include your solution. For more substantial contributions, please make a pull request.
