1) Don't piss me off.
2) While there are many things that might piss me off, attempting to play lawyer with this Code of Conduct is **guaranteed** to piss me off. It't not negotiable. It's not up for debate. If you don't like it, your screen has a fork button on it the same as mine.
3) There are about a billion places on the internet to discuss/argue about politics. This isn't one of them. That's another thing that is pretty much guaranteed to piss me off.

That's it. That's the CoC.
